# Solar Detection

As part of the AI4ALL Ignite program, we learned about different AI and machine learning topics, as well as responsible AI. In a team of 3, we worked to create a supervised regression machine learning model that would detect the optimal environment/location for solar panel placement.

## Problem Statement <!--- do not change this line -->

(UPDATE IN README.md)
Given the worsening climate, we wanted to create something that could help increase the ease of renewable energy implementation. This project would hopefully make it easier for governments and businesses to implement solar panel installations, limiting greenhouse gas emissions.

## Key Results <!--- do not change this line -->

Created a supervised regression machine learning model to detect optimal solar panel installation locations.


## Methodologies <!--- do not change this line -->

Compared different models, parameters, and combinations of features using accuracy scores, correlation graphs, and feature importances to maximize accuracy in the real world. We landed on XGBoost Regression algorithm.
